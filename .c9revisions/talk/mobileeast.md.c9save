This is my second day in a row here in Cambridge, yesterday I spoke about cloud development and the steps that we've made in the past two years and today is more hands on. We are going to build a mobile application for your phone using only in-browser tooling. Unleash Cloud9, Ripple and PhoneGap Cloud.\n\n[bla bla cloud9]\n\nApache Cordova, formerly PhoneGap, is a set of tools dedicated to creating stand-alone mobile applications using standard web technology. That also means that there is just one code base but it's still possible to target multiple devices, from iOS to Blackberry and from WebOS to Windows Phone 7. The inner working of PhoneGap is no black magic. It's just a full screen web browser. The great power lays in the ability to talk to phone specific API's that are not exposed in the web browser. That means that your app can access f.e. the accelerometer, something that is not possible from the browser. Also PhoneGap handles the touch friendliness of a UI by providing skin files for common UI elements like buttons, textboxes and labels.\n\nThe Ripple emulator is complementary to Cordova. It's an in-browser device emulator that works as a Chrome extension. The cool thing is that both the application you're developing as well as Ripple both use WebKit which results in pretty accurate renderings. Ripple handles stuff that your normal browser won't do, like adapting form factors, handling orientation change and the accelerometer; plus emulating things like your contacts. If you've used any Android emulators you will see the resemblence. As said Ripple is just an application that you can install as a Chrome extension.\n\nSo in this session we'll create an application in Cloud9, using Cordova, then test it in Ripple in our own browser and then use PhoneGap Cloud to build the actual application and even test it on your own device. As long as you have an Android or Blackberry device because they don't have to be rooted."]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1957}]],"length":1957,"saved":false}
